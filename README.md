# domains-blocker

### this script blocks domains on the computer

naturally the idea is not mine, I just implemented a well-known principle

## How it works

<pre>
object = DomainsBlocker([domain, ])      # create a class object, a list of domains as a parameter
object.start(time_start, time_finish)    # execute the start method with the time frame as a parameters
</pre>
